<h1>Introduction to Proof Pad</h1>

<div class="wrap">

  <div class="defs">Definitions</div>
  <div class="pb"><div style="-webkit-transform:rotate(90deg);white-space:nowrap;">Proof Bar</div></div>
  <div class="repl">REPL</div>
</div>

<h2>The REPL</h2>
<p>The REPL, or "Read-Eval-Print loop", is located in the bottom half
of the main Proof Pad window. Essentially, the REPL will execute any
code you type in the text field on bottom (the "prompt") and show the
result in the log above.
<p>Try typing some math into the REPL now:
<pre><code>(+ 1 2)</code></pre>
If ACL2 is functioning correctly, you should get
<pre><code>3</code></pre>
back. (If you don't, see <a href="troubleshooting.html">the
    troubleshooting page.</a>)
<p>There are a couple of things to note at this point. First, the '3'
has a checkmark with a green background next to it. This means that the
function call executed without errors. A red 'x' means that there was an
error, and a '&lt;' sign means that the message is informational (not
in direct response to something you did).</p>
<p>The REPL is a good place to test the functions you write in the
definitions area, or just to get a sense of how to use a certain
function or feature.</p>
<h2>The definitions area</h2>
<p>The definitions area is where you write your functions, theorems, and
other state-altering expressions. Here's a definition for 'sum' that you
can either retype or copy and paste:
<pre><code>(defun sum (xs)
(if (endp xs)
0
(+ (first xs)
  (sum (rest xs)))))</code></pre>
<p>When you type or paste this into the definitions area, you might
notice that the background color of the proof bar goes from white to
grey to light green, and a checkmark appears. This simply means that the
code was executed by ACL2 without any problems. We'll talk more about
the proof bar in the <a href="#proofbar">next section</a>
<p>Definitions occur in an ordered way in the file; if you want to use
the function "foo" within the function "bar", you must put the
definition of "foo" above the definition of "bar". This has to do with
how ACL2 processes events; the ACL2 "world" must be logically consistent
after each and every event, so if you used "foo" before defining it,
ACL2 might be accepting something that won't actually work.
<h2 id="proofbar">Proof bar</h2>
<p>The proof bar is the (normally white) bar to the left of the
definitions panel that allows you to view and manipulate the status of
ACL2 with respect to your code.
<p>By default, Proof Pad is passing all of your functions, theorems,
tests, etc to ACL2 automatically. This automatic admission occurs in
<tt>:program</tt> mode<sup>1</sup>, an ACL2 mode where ACL2 doesn't
worry as much about logic. The intent of this is to let you test your
functions in the REPL, even if they aren't carefully written enough in
the way ACL2 expects to be used in :logic mode.
<p>If the automatic admission succeeds, the proof bar turns light green
next to the admitted code. If it fails, it instead turns red, an 'x' is
shown, and the details pane opens up to show you the error message you
received.
<p>You will probably want to admit these functions to ACL2's
<tt>:logic</tt> mode (a requirement if you want to prove theorems). To
do this, click on the proof bar next to the function you want to admit.
As you hover over the proof bar, it will show you a preview of what's
going to be done; in particular, if you want to admit an expression, you
have to first admit all the expressions above it. The proof bar handles
this for you.
<p>Once you've admitted some code to the ACL2 logic (which can take
some time for complex functions or theorems), the proof bar turns green
next to the form or forms that were admitted. If ACL2 encounters an
error, a red 'x' is shown and the error pane opens to show you the
response that Proof Pad got from ACL2. If the proof or admission was
successful, the error pane won't open up by default. If you're curious
about what the ACL2 output was, you can click the '&gt;' sign to the
right of the form you admitted (though you rarely care about that if the
proof succeeds).
<p>Try admitting your <tt>sum</tt> function from before.</p>
<p>Admitted code becomes read-only in Proof Pad, since editing it
requires re-admitting it to ACL2. To un-admit some code (and thus make
it editable), just click on the proof bar again next to the expression
you want to edit. Proof Pad will roll back ACL2 to the function you want
to edit. You can make your edits and then re-admit.

        <li>You can read more about ACL2's two modes <a
            href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~moore/acl2/current/DEFUN-MODE.html">here</a>,
        though this is strictly optional reading; you don't need to have
        an intimate understanding of this for Proof Pad, since it
        abstracts these parts away for you.
